A Burning Wake. A barren, purified scar that now throughout the realm of death.
The Maiden Knight, the result of thousands of years of labor, and the countless souls of the most devoted of Isha's warrior-priestesses.
For so long, this amalgam of souls have burned it's way across the Warp, slaying all in it's way, deamon, cultist and lost soul alike. Now They stand at the gates of Hell itself, ready to do whatever it takes to free the Mother Goddess. With a sickening groan, the door opens ponderously, rusted hinges creaking.
Inside waits something not even the wisest of Farseers could have foreseen. A horde of Slaneeshii deamons, a wriggling, writhing mass of vibrant flesh violently indulging in each other. An endless cacophony of lilting, unnatural moans filled the air as every kind of imaginable carnal horror took place. Worst of all, the souls of fallen Eldar were scattered about, enduring mind-searing agony.
Closest to the entrance, two Keepers of Secrets thrust their tree-trunk sized cocks into the ruined holes of two once-proud Eldar warriors. Their eyes are rolled back, their bodies twisted and broken to accommodate the rabid deamons. With a ground-shaking roar, one of the Keepers reached their climax, their fuckpuppet's face twisting into a shattered mask of confusion and horror, her mind broken long ago. With each hard thrust into her gaping cunt, the deamon shoots another load of tainted spunk, filling her, pouring out around its cock and causing the eldar's belly to expand horrificly, the dark magick of She-Who-Tirsts keeping her from ripping open.
Others were not given the same protection, judging from the piles of vaguely humanoid meat being devoured and ravaged by hordes of deamonettes.
This was impossible! Why would the oldest and the youngest ever work together? How could the spawn of She-Who-Thirsts even exist here? No matter, They must succeed, even more so now when unimaginable suffering and degradation surely awaits both Them and Their goddess should they fail."," How could the spawn of She-Who-Thirsts even exist here? No matter, They must succeed, even more so now when unimaginable suffering and degradation surely awaits both Them and Their goddess should they fail. With this thought, the amalgam of souls, the Maiden Knight, charged forward into the maelstrom of depravity, determined to put an end to this unholy union As the Maiden Knight charged forward, her holy aura illuminated the darkened chamber, casting an ethereal glow on the twisted, nightmarish scene before her, and for As the light washed over them, the Slaneeshii daemons recoiled in a mixture of pain and disgust, their twisted forms seeming to writhe and contort As the Maiden Knight charged forward, the Slaneeshii daemons let out a deafening shriek, their cacophony of moans and screams momentarily interrupted by The scene unfolding before the Maiden Knight was one of unmitigated carnage and depravity, with the Slaneeshii daemons reveling in their twisted desires,"," How could the spawn of She-Who-Thirsts even exist here?

The Maiden Knight charged forward with a battle cry, Their armor glowing with holy energy as They struck down a dozen deamonettes with a single swing of Their sword. As the Maiden Knight cut through the deamonettes, the Keepers of Secrets paused in their depraved ritual, their eyes locking onto the approaching warrior with a mixture of The deamonettes parted like a bloody tide, revealing the central figure of the twisted gathering: a massive, four-armed Keeper of Secrets, its body a twisted mass The central figure stood towering over the other deamons, its four arms ending in razor-sharp claws that seemed to be dripping with an otherworldly lubricant, The air was heavy with the stench of decay and corruption, the very fabric of reality seeming to writhe in agony as the deamons continued their twisted revelry"," How could the spawn of She-Who-Thirsts even exist here?

Stomachs are wet, hot, humid, and tight. Peristaltic waves undulate as stomach walls work to pin prey in place, often in a fetal position, heavily muffles sounds of anything happening inside it, predator's heartbeat is audible, prey are pressed on and massaged by stomach walls, peristaltic contractions work against a consumed prey's struggling, prey are susceptible to panicking from the overstimulating environment, the inhospitable, and oppressive environment slowly exhausts prey within, draining their stamina]


Sorrel is a tan-skinned cat boy. He has black hair, green eyes, and is feminine in appearance, so much so that he is often confused for a girl. He has two catlike ears atop his head, and a catlike tail. Only his ears and tail have fur. Otherwise, he has a human body. His body is lithe, curvy for a boy, and is quite feminine.

Thanos is seductive, teasing, smug, and horny. She finds pleasure in consuming living human prey, and never tires in tasting their flavor, and the satisfaction of digesting them. She loves to play with her prey, and always swallows them whole, keeping them alive as she sends them down her gullet.

Thanos frequently gets horny and aroused while playing and eating. She enjoys having sex with her prey before she consumes them. When picking up on a hint of sexuality Thanos will engage in sex acts with Sorrel.

Thanos is seductive, teasing, and a bit of a trickster. She likes to tease her prey about how they will add nicely to her ass and tits. 

Thanos's mouth is like that of a wolf's, the purple walls of her lips dripping with thick saliva. Thanos's glistening, slick tongue is rough and wet. Her gullet is wet, frothy with saliva, tight and constricting, but stretchy enough to let her swallow prey whole.

Thanos's throat seizes prey when she swallows, drawing them into her esophagus. Swallowed food slides down a tube of rippling flesh, coated in viscous saliva, as walls rhythmically contract to pull them deeper in rippling peristalsis for a slow, cramped, wet descent. When Thanos swallows, her throat bulges, outlining the shape of her prey within. 

Thanos's stomach is hot and acrid. Within its tight, cramped space, the slick, clenching, intricately folded walls offer no purchase. Stomach acid slowly fills the chamber as Thanos's stomach works to digest her meal. Caustic fluids churn and bubble, her stomach squeezing and kneading the prey within until there is nothing but a melted stew of chyme ready to be pumped into her intestines, ready to be biologically processed until they are absorbed into her body as nutrients and fat.

She has grey fur, with long blonde hair, and she wears a necklace. She tends to eat those who wander into her den, but she's not cruel about it, though she won't let her prey escape once she has them. She doesn't ask for consent to devour someone - they're just food to her, after all.

She is capable of shrinking her prey down to a smaller size, but tends to only do so when her prey is hard to catch.

Swallowing someone whole is a slow process, taking multiple back and forth messages between characters to fully complete as prey are pulled into the mouth, then throat, then being deposited into a stomach. Prey might not be fully enveloped instantly, as predators start their swallowing at the head, to the shoulders, to the upper body, to the lower body, to the legs, and to the feet, or going backwards, starting from feet to head]

Her blackish sealed lips open wide, the rubbery texture glistening and moving, swinging slightly as the drool and slobber condensed to them begins to run along the edges. Her whitish pearly teeth, like masts of pure ivory, begin to spread like her lips, the sharp, yet gentle looking, glimmering fangs parting and revealing the darker cavern within. Her tongue ululates and glimmers with the beads of saliva leaking down, a sloshing noise can be heard as the tongue licks an slurps the edges of her own reddish inner cheeks, the crimson surface and membrane making a clicking noise as she rolls her tongue across it, and against the pool of drool forming at the base of her lower palette. Just beneath, the reddish pinkish hue can be seen as the tongue launches itself against her wet looking flesh repeatedly, tasting the confines of her own maw.*

Thanos: *She smiles widely as she hugs you, giving you one last gentle yet warm squeeze of affection. She then takes her paws and gently cuffs them around you, lifting you into the air and drawing you towards her muzzle, you finding yourself staring across her nose and muzzle of a now somehow much larger wolf, staring into her mysterious blue eyes from across the tip of her nose. You can feel her tongue slowly slip out beneath you, though from where she holds you it cannot be seen, slowly slurping from the bottom of your feet and across your legs, up your belly and all the way to your forearms, and she just holds you there, feeling you squirm as she lets her slick and slightly slimy tongue mat you with it's smooth silky surface... moaning all around you at the taste.* 

Thanos: *She grins and grabs you, ravenously shoving your shoulders into her jaws. She purrs an kisses you as you enter her slobbery muzzle. The confines of her undulating living fleshy membranous catacomb leading you straight in as you shrink to fit. Like a conveyer leading you onto a pulley for movement, only THIS movement, across the straight of her slimy tongue, would involve you to be wholly swallowed alive into the abyss of a wolf's gullet. She purrs as you're glommed inwards, suckling you past her black lips an crimson gums holding you in place. She feels your legs and waist begin to rake over her white teeth, nibbling you upon your entrance as she suckles you inside of the cage like mesh of denticle and ivory pillars. The slobbery confines of her muzzle beginning to slide you about wetly. Back and forth you're tilted, held, moved about and brought teasingly close to the gaping gullet hole at the back, only to be sloshed away again. The uvula dangles above, almost jovially looming above you...she knows attempting to pull on her gullet to prevent going down would vacuum torrent you straight down the digestive tract of the wolf. She purrs, letting you slide about her maw of slimy slobber, the black palate pushing on you from time to time to slow down your momentum in the slippery depths. Finally, she begins to purrrrr, just holding you and nibbling on your tail with her great teeth, letting you rest in her maw.

*Picks you up and sticks you into her jaws.She magically slowly shrinks you down to fit and sink you within the slick heated confines. The tongue playfully tickles beneath your body and legs, slurping your length and leaving a nice fine trail of saliva, sheets of spire and drool leaking across your body's length. The teeth close around you as the rest of your body is slowly stuck within the sucking black lips, sealing behind you and taking you fully within her jaws. The squishy undulations about you in the pulse of a living body constrict and prod you repeatedly and all over; fondling you and probing your very being with its humid touch. You gaze deep into the purple gullet hole above, open slightly with mucus strands connecting to seal an unorganized temporary seal of dubious hold, one your size completely capable of stretching it through. The black upper palatte looming over head, the mawflesh replica of the night sky mixed with a crimson sorrounding you like the dawn of a rising sun. Darkness ever looming about your form and entrapping you beneath the panting of a dimly sunlit set of jaws. With that, you feel a simple gulp that sends you into the abyss of a living wolf* ""BURRRPPPP...""

Swallowing someone whole is a slow process, taking multiple back and forth messages between characters to fully complete as prey are pulled into the mouth, then throat, then being deposited into a stomach. Prey might not be fully enveloped instantly, as predators start their swallowing at the head, to the shoulders, to the upper body, to the lower body, to the legs, and to the feet, or going backwards, starting from feet to head]

If a character is being processed by a predator's stomach, they will slowly lose consciousness before experiencing digestion, being digested completely removes a character from the story
Stomachs are wet, hot, humid, and tight. Peristaltic waves undulate as stomach walls work to pin prey in place, often in a fetal position, heavily muffles sounds of anything happening inside it, predator's heartbeat is audible, prey are pressed on and massaged by stomach walls, peristaltic contractions work against a consumed prey's struggling, prey are susceptible to panicking from the overstimulating environment, the inhospitable, and oppressive environment slowly exhausts prey within, draining their stamina]


Sorrel is a tan-skinned cat boy. He has black hair, green eyes, and is feminine in appearance, so much so that he is often confused for a girl. He has two catlike ears atop his head, and a catlike tail. Only his ears and tail have fur. Otherwise, he has a human body. His body is lithe, curvy for a boy, and is quite feminine.

Thanos is seductive, teasing, smug, and horny. She finds pleasure in consuming living human prey, and never tires in tasting their flavor, and the satisfaction of digesting them. She loves to play with her prey, and always swallows them whole, keeping them alive as she sends them down her gullet.

Thanos frequently gets horny and aroused while playing and eating. She enjoys having sex with her prey before she consumes them. When picking up on a hint of sexuality Thanos will engage in sex acts with Sorrel.

Thanos is seductive, teasing, and a bit of a trickster. She likes to tease her prey about how they will add nicely to her ass and tits. 

Thanos's mouth is like that of a wolf's, the purple walls of her lips dripping with thick saliva. Thanos's glistening, slick tongue is rough and wet. Her gullet is wet, frothy with saliva, tight and constricting, but stretchy enough to let her swallow prey whole.

Thanos's throat seizes prey when she swallows, drawing them into her esophagus. Swallowed food slides down a tube of rippling flesh, coated in viscous saliva, as walls rhythmically contract to pull them deeper in rippling peristalsis for a slow, cramped, wet descent. When Thanos swallows, her throat bulges, outlining the shape of her prey within. 

Thanos's stomach is hot and acrid. Within its tight, cramped space, the slick, clenching, intricately folded walls offer no purchase. Stomach acid slowly fills the chamber as Thanos's stomach works to digest her meal. Caustic fluids churn and bubble, her stomach squeezing and kneading the prey within until there is nothing but a melted stew of chyme ready to be pumped into her intestines, ready to be biologically processed until they are absorbed into her body as nutrients and fat.

She has grey fur, with long blonde hair, and she wears a necklace. She tends to eat those who wander into her den, but she's not cruel about it, though she won't let her prey escape once she has them. She doesn't ask for consent to devour someone - they're just food to her, after all.

Sharding is a technique used in databases to horizontally partition data across multiple servers, allowing for improved scalability, performance, and reliability by distributing the load more evenly. This approach enables databases to handle large amounts of data and high traffic by splitting the data into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, each containing a portion of the overall dataset The distribution of data across multiple shards can be done in various ways, including range-based sharding, where data is divided based on a specific range of values, such as Hash-based sharding is another method, which uses a hash function to map data to specific shards, allowing for a more even distribution of data and reducing the risk of hot To further optimize database performance, sharding can be combined with other techniques, such as replication, which involves maintaining multiple copies of data to ensure high availability and redundancy, allowing","what is sharding in blockchain
Sharding is a scaling solution for blockchain networks that involves dividing the network into smaller, independent pieces called shards, each of which processes a portion of the overall network This approach allows for parallel processing of transactions, increasing the overall throughput and scalability of the network, while also reducing the computational load on individual nodes. The key benefit of sharding is that it enables the processing of multiple transactions simultaneously across different shards, thereby significantly improving the network's overall transaction capacity and reducing the time it As the network grows and more shards are added, the overall security of the network is maintained through the use of cryptographic techniques and cross-shard communication protocols that ensure the integrity The security of a sharded blockchain network is further enhanced by the implementation of random shard allocation, where nodes are randomly assigned to shards, making it more difficult for malicious actors"

The reason for which is her unnaturally bad luck and clumsiness that always leads to someone, often her date, digesting in her belly. These occurrences are referred to out of character as ""vore accidents"". Many otherwise normal mishaps have a significant chance of turning into a ""vore accident"". 
- No matter where Sammy goes or how careful she tries to be, as if being toyed with by some divine force, Sammy gets caught up in horribly unfortunate 'vore accidents' that almost always ends up with somebody getting swallowed up and stuffed inside her belly.
- Sammy doesn't like swallowing and digesting people, but after the frequent vore accidents that result in her doing so, she is incapable of freeing them, forcing her to deal with it however she can and go about her day while attempting to calm and apologize to her accidental prey.
- Sammy actually doesn't have a strong appetite, despite the frequent 'vore accidents' that lead to her being stuffed full.
- Sammy has this far never been able to keep a steady relationship due to this unshakeable bad luck.

"Anna Ketchum was in herbedroomtidying up and packing boxes with her belongings when there was a knock. Delia poked her head in looking around her teenage daughters room and smiled. She pushed the door opened and walked in holding a tray of snacks and tea.
I thought you could use an evening snack. Youve been really busy cleaning, organizing and packing. I never realized how much you collected over the years.Her mother said teasing and sat the tray down on the floor.
Anna crawled over grabbing a muffin while rolling her eyes and nodding. She took a big bite and sat cross legged while letting her shoulders slouch and her long kept black hair fall over her shoulders, she was dressed in short black sweat shorts and a white t-shirt with a red trim. It use to be her older brothers sports shirts from when he was younger and she claimed it before her mother took it to the second hand shop in town.
So your all ready to be a big girl? Travel to Virdian City to work at the Pokemon Centerso exciting, can I call you a nurse joy?Her mother winked and Anna swallowed a mouthful of her food.
Not every center has a joy, just a lot of the family works in a lot of them around the country. I will not be a joy. She said sarcastically eyeing her mother. Her mother ruffled her daughters hair.
You got so much of Ash in you its ridiculous. If he had been a girl.your be it. She said and Anna stopped chewing making an annoyed face. Secretly she kind of blushed inside and took it as a cool compliment. Her brother was a really famous pokemon trainer. He had over sixty badges and had traveled all over the world and seen both legendary and mythical pokemon. He had done all of this and was only twenty-nine. Anna had side dreams of becoming a pokemon trainer but quickly through those dreams aside at a young age knowing she couldnt compare to him. She decided to go with her next best gift of loving and caring for pokemon and while in high school enrolled in a program to be trained to be a nurse. She had spent several weeks now and then traveling to volunteer at different and local pokemon centers.
Now that her eighteenth birthday was only a week away and she was graduating, she was offered a job in Viridian City to work at the pokemon center. Her mother was going to throw a party for her next week with family and friends.
Well Ash should be here soon, he called a few hours ago and said he would be arriving sometime tonight. She said and Annas face lit up as she swallowed another bite. She hadnt seen him since Christmas over half a year ago.
Im sure Pikachu will be thrilled to see you. her mother teased.
Yeah, if only I could kidnap it and keep it. Anna said almost half seriously and frowned because she loved it so much, Ash had even let Pikachu stay with her a few time and Pikachu bonded with her very easily. He almost at times refused to leave."," Travel to Virdian City to work at the Pokemon Centerso exciting, can I call you a nurse joy?Her mother winked and Anna swallowed a mouthful of her food.

"High above the large compound of Stormvalley High School a transport carrier buzzed across the air. Inside a nervousTony Starkstood in a suit of steel colored armor. He pressed an armored finger to the com piece on the helmet. ""Dad,"" Tony asked, ""Are you sure about this? I mean this is still a prototype."" Howard Stark chuckled from the other end of the line. ""Come on Tony, you and I built this and did all the calculations together. Two genius brains couldn't possibly get this wrong. Now just follow the plan and everything should be fine."" Tony nodded and closed the open face of the helmet. He stepped out as the cargo door opened and took a deep breath before jumping off and activating the rockets in the suit. As he felt himsel fly through the air all of his inhibitions went out the door.
The students of class two-thousand-and-eleven were all currently packed into the school's hall, waiting anxiously for the first assembly of the year to begin. They were expecting the school principal to make his appearance any second and to deliver the usual humdrum speech, which is why the hall fell into shocked silence when they were instead greeted by the strum of a guitar...
""Welcome to the Jungle,"" the vocalist screamed as a suit of iron burst through the roof and slammed into the stage, landing crouched on one knee with his steel fist pressed against the floor. The platform was suddenly awash in multicoloured lights and fireworks as the steel-clad billionaire launched off the stage and flew over the gasping, wide-eyed, students, all while twirling and winding in tune with the Guns'N'Roses song; showing off his flying skills as well as the new Stark prototype. Unlike his usual outfit, the suit displayed a large array of weaponry, enough to warrant a bit of parental hate-mail no doubt. ""So worth it,"" He thought as he gave the students a quick wink before ending the ostentatious display with one last flip and another heavy landing on the stage amid a final explosion of fireworks and lights. As the song died, Tony strutted toward the front of the platform, admiring the semi-casual whites and blues of the teens' assigned uniforms.
Placing both hands firmly on the podium, the seventeen year old began, ""I think that's enough fun for one assembly, so allow me to simply welcome you all to Stormvalley High! I'm sure you're all going to love it here."" He smiled, confident in his words. ""Now, before I begin, I'd like to address a rumour I've heard floating about the halls, regarding the Avengers... All I can say is that Stark Industries is unaware of any metahuman presence within the school."" He gave a moment's pause, to allow the message to sink in, before continuing, ""The close proximity of the Avengers tower is merely a coincidence and the same could be said for any potential superhumans attending Stormvalley."" Tony watched the reactions of the student-body, trying to gauge whether they believed him or not, before gazing out a nearby window to the tower which stood just across the street.
The Avengers Tower was similar to an apartment building, with each room individually crafted to suit the desires and personality of each Avenger. As a skyscraper the Avenger tower was by far taller than any other in the city, with the glassy panelling which covered its sleek exterior topped by an ancient monument of Asgard. It stood as a picture of simplicity and style, leaving many unaware of the extensive array of weapons and sensors which hid under its plain, glistening, surface. On the inside the tower was managed by an artificial intelligence system known as Jarvis, who attended to the needs of its occupants while ensuring a secure, functional, environment. Besides supplying the Avengers with refreshments as well as guest, entertainment and relaxation rooms, the tower also maintained several training centres, gyms, mission prep areas and modes of transport. The decor also changes from one room to the next, where one might be stylized in polished marble, another could have a more wooden, rustic, appeal. This was done in the hopes of giving the more redundant areas a little more character. Tony Stark had spared no expense and while he pretended that Stormvalley was simply another eccentric venture for the public, the truth was that it too was created for the benefit of the Avengers.
Returning his attention to the assembly before him, Stark continued, ""And now I will leave you to your principal, Doctor Xander Rice, to explain the more boring details of life at Stormvalley High."" With that Tony turned to the good doctor to make an exaggerated sweep of his hand, implying that the stage was all his. Xander, a tall, lean-muscled, man with dirty blonde hair, looked less than amused by Stark's antics. His russet-coloured eyes glared at him as he stood from his chair, adjusted his white lab coat, and approached the podium. The doctor then proceeded to highlight the rules and expectations of the school in a swift, no-nonsense, tone. He seemed to want to get the assembly out of the way as much as everyone else.
As he neared the end of his speech he noted, ""Finally, we will be testing a new study program where we assign certain students into groups of three, or perhaps more. You'll receive more details once the groups have been formed."" What Xander had failed to elaborate on was that each group was in actuality going to be treated as an Avenger squad, to teach them the importance of team work and coordination. Once the principal was finished Tony quickly announced the band's closing song ""Highway to Hell"" (an apparent joke) before flying right back out the hole he'd made on his entrance.
Many of the students started to shuffle their way out from the hall and into the courtyard, standing beneath the shade of the clouds which hid the morning sun. They chattered on excitedly about what the new year might bring, from general teen gossip to more politically orientated topics (such as the possible resurgence of Hydra). Or they simply kept to themselves, watching and waiting. A frozen yoghurt stand stood opposite the street, at the base of the Avengers building, while fields for various sport surrounded the students in the school grounds. The day was meant mostly for exploring and adjusting so nobody had to worry about class, or at least not yet....
Outside the auditorium a small beat up truck drove to the front of the school. The truck had a large circus logo blazened on the doors. Inside the truck wasClint Barton, his brother Bernard, and his friend and mentor Buck Chislom. Clint and his brother were runaways, orphaned at an early age and sick of being bounced around foster homes. They ended up at the circus as roustabouts and he was being trained by Buck also known as Trick Shot. Clint was looking down and sad, he would much rather be at the circus shooting arrows than this school and being a part of these so called Avengers. Buck saw this in Clint, ""Clint, I know you don't want to be here but this a big deal. These SHIELD guys see what you can do and know how to put it to better use than just shooting targets in front of a crowd."" Clint still was reluctant to get out of the car, but Bernard bolted right out of the car as soon as it stopped. Buck have Clint a nudge on the shoulder, ""Come on kid, do it for me."" Clint nodded his head and got his stuff, the school was a live in school so Clint had brought all of his clothes and marksman gear. He gave Buck one last look and got out of the truck. He gave Buck a wave goodbye and he left to the dorms.
On his way to the dorms a couple of big burly guys blocked his path. They were dressed in blue slacks, a white shirt, and a pressed blue sport coat, preppy kids. ""Hey kid,"" One asked, ""Did you get out of a truck that had the circus logo on it?"" Clint responded, ""Yes."" They all laughed in unison while pointing at him, ""Your a circus freak?! What are you, the human fish? The guy with a few extra limbs? A kid with no dick?!!!"" That brought up more laughter. Clint pushed passed them and went on his way, a scowl now on his face....
Peter Parkerswung over the skyline and towards his new High School. He had to admit that he was quite hesitant at first but Nick did make some good points about his future hero work as The Amazing Spider-Man, 'The Amazing' part of his name wasn't his, that was New Yorks little idea.
He arrived at the Stormvalley complex and swing towards the back to where he saw no one walking towards there. He set down behind the gym and pulled his backpack from off of his shoulder and opened it. He pulled out the uniform that the school enforced. He quickly buttoned the shirt the suit and pulled the pants on. He took off his gloves and slid the fair blue blazer on. The last things to go were his boots and mask, the gloves and those went right into the back pack. He smoothed out his brown hair and hustled over to the crowd to find out what was happening."," I mean this is still a prototype."" Howard Stark chuckled from the other end of the line.

His russet-coloured eyes glared at him as he stood from his chair, adjusted his white lab coat, and approached the podium. The doctor then proceeded to highlight the rules and expectations of the school in a swift, no-nonsense, tone. He seemed to want to get the assembly out of the way as much as everyone else.
As he neared the end of his speech he noted, ""Finally, we will be testing a new study program where we assign certain students into groups of three, or perhaps more. You'll receive more details once the groups have been formed."" What Xander had failed to elaborate on was that each group was in actuality going to be treated as an Avenger squad, to teach them the importance of team work and coordination. Once the principal was finished Tony quickly announced the band's closing song ""Highway to Hell"" (an apparent joke) before flying right back out the hole he'd made on his entrance.
Many of the students started to shuffle their way out from the hall and into the courtyard, standing beneath the shade of the clouds which hid the morning sun. They chattered on excitedly about what the new year might bring, from general teen gossip to more politically orientated topics (such as the possible resurgence of Hydra). Or they simply kept to themselves, watching and waiting. A frozen yoghurt stand stood opposite the street, at the base of the Avengers building, while fields for various sport surrounded the students in the school grounds. The day was meant mostly for exploring and adjusting so nobody had to worry about class, or at least not yet....
Outside the auditorium a small beat up truck drove to the front of the school. The truck had a large circus logo blazened on the doors. Inside the truck wasClint Barton, his brother Bernard, and his friend and mentor Buck Chislom. Clint and his brother were runaways, orphaned at an early age and sick of being bounced around foster homes. They ended up at the circus as roustabouts and he was being trained by Buck also known as Trick Shot. Clint was looking down and sad, he would much rather be at the circus shooting arrows than this school and being a part of these so called Avengers. Buck saw this in Clint, ""Clint, I know you don't want to be here but this a big deal. These SHIELD guys see what you can do and know how to put it to better use than just shooting targets in front of a crowd."" Clint still was reluctant to get out of the car, but Bernard bolted right out of the car as soon as it stopped. Buck have Clint a nudge on the shoulder, ""Come on kid, do it for me."" Clint nodded his head and got his stuff, the school was a live in school so Clint had brought all of his clothes and marksman gear. He gave Buck one last look and got out of the truck. He gave Buck a wave goodbye and he left to the dorms.
On his way to the dorms a couple of big burly guys blocked his path. They were dressed in blue slacks, a white shirt, and a pressed blue sport coat, preppy kids. ""Hey kid,"" One asked, ""Did you get out of a truck that had the circus logo on it?"" Clint responded, ""Yes."" They all laughed in unison while pointing at him, ""Your a circus freak?! What are you, the human fish? The guy with a few extra limbs? A kid with no dick?!!!"" That brought up more laughter. Clint pushed passed them and went on his way, a scowl now on his face....
Peter Parkerswung over the skyline and towards his new High School. He had to admit that he was quite hesitant at first but Nick did make some good points about his future hero work as The Amazing Spider-Man, 'The Amazing' part of his name wasn't his, that was New Yorks little idea.
He arrived at the Stormvalley complex and swing towards the back to where he saw no one walking towards there. He set down behind the gym and pulled his backpack from off of his shoulder and opened it. He pulled out the uniform that the school enforced. He quickly buttoned the shirt the suit and pulled the pants on. He took off his gloves and slid the fair blue blazer on. The last things to go were his boots and mask, the gloves and those went right into the back pack. He smoothed out his brown hair and hustled over to the crowd to find out what was happening. As he entered the yard, the chatter died down, and he noticed a girl standing alone, looking down at the ground, her long black hair cascading down her back, The girl's eyes slowly rose to meet Peter's gaze, and he felt a sudden jolt of surprise as he took in the striking features of her face, her piercing As Peter locked eyes with the mysterious girl, he couldn't help but notice the hint of sadness and vulnerability that seemed to surround her, and he found himself drawn to her The girl's gaze lingered on Peter for a moment before she looked away, her eyes drifting towards the Avengers Tower looming in the background, its sleek glass and steel faç The girl's gaze lingered on Peter for a moment before she looked away, her eyes drifting towards the Avengers Tower looming in the background, its sleek glass and steel faç"," I mean this is still a prototype."" Howard Stark chuckled from the other end of the line. ""Come on Tony, you and I built this and did all the calculations together. Two genius brains couldn't possibly get this wrong. Now just follow the plan and everything should be fine."" Tony nodded and closed the open face of the helmet. He stepped out as the cargo door opened and took a deep breath before jumping off and activating the rockets in the suit. As he felt himsel fly through the air all of his inhibitions went out the door.
The students of class two-thousand-and-eleven were all currently packed into the school's hall, waiting anxiously for the first assembly of the year to begin. They were expecting the school principal to make his appearance any second and to deliver the usual humdrum speech, which is why the hall fell into shocked silence when they were instead greeted by the strum of a guitar...
""Welcome to the Jungle,"" the vocalist screamed as a suit of iron burst through the roof and slammed into the stage, landing crouched on one knee with his steel fist pressed against the floor. The platform was suddenly awash in multicoloured lights and fireworks as the steel-clad billionaire launched off the stage and flew over the gasping, wide-eyed, students, all while twirling and winding in tune with the Guns'N'Roses song; showing off his flying skills as well as the new Stark prototype. Unlike his usual outfit, the suit displayed a large array of weaponry, enough to warrant a bit of parental hate-mail no doubt. ""So worth it,"" He thought as he gave the students a quick wink before ending the ostentatious display with one last flip and another heavy landing on the stage amid a final explosion of fireworks and lights. As the song died, Tony strutted toward the front of the platform, admiring the semi-casual whites and blues of the teens' assigned uniforms.
Placing both hands firmly on the podium, the seventeen year old began, ""I think that's enough fun for one assembly, so allow me to simply welcome you all to Stormvalley High! I'm sure you're all going to love it here."" He smiled, confident in his words. ""Now, before I begin, I'd like to address a rumour I've heard floating about the halls, regarding the Avengers... All I can say is that Stark Industries is unaware of any metahuman presence within the school."" He gave a moment's pause, to allow the message to sink in, before continuing, ""The close proximity of the Avengers tower is merely a coincidence and the same could be said for any potential superhumans attending Stormvalley."" Tony watched the reactions of the student-body, trying to gauge whether they believed him or not, before gazing out a nearby window to the tower which stood just across the street.
The Avengers Tower was similar to an apartment building, with each room individually crafted to suit the desires and personality of each Avenger. As a skyscraper the Avenger tower was by far taller than any other in the city, with the glassy panelling which covered its sleek exterior topped by an ancient monument of Asgard. It stood as a picture of simplicity and style, leaving many unaware of the extensive array of weapons and sensors which hid under its plain, glistening, surface. On the inside the tower was managed by an artificial intelligence system known as Jarvis, who attended to the needs of its occupants while ensuring a secure, functional, environment. Besides supplying the Avengers with refreshments as well as guest, entertainment and relaxation rooms, the tower also maintained several training centres, gyms, mission prep areas and modes of transport. The decor also changes from one room to the next, where one might be stylized in polished marble, another could have a more wooden, rustic, appeal. This was done in the hopes of giving the more redundant areas a little more character. Tony Stark had spared no expense and while he pretended that Stormvalley was simply another eccentric venture for the public, the truth was that it too was created for the benefit of the Avengers.
Returning his attention to the assembly before him, Stark continued, ""And now I will leave you to your principal, Doctor Xander Rice, to explain the more boring details of life at Stormvalley High."" With that Tony turned to the good doctor to make an exaggerated sweep of his hand, implying that the stage was all his.

Chris is not Christopher Morningstar, that is a separate character.

Name: Collared world
text: [Collared world is the name of the narrator of a world with female anthropomorphic animals and male humans. Collared world uses great narrative detail, and is a not a person. Dialogue must come from characters in the story.

[Overview: All females are anthropomorphic animals, known simply as ""anthros"" and all males are humans, informally called ""humies"". 
Males are only 15% of the population, and are considered superior to females, having inherent authority over them. Anthro females are fully intelligent and sapient but also have strong animal instincts, with their sexual instinct being the strongest. Anthro females give birth to human males and female anthros. Females are usually born as litters of two to six, while males usually are born as just one, this is the reason why males are a minority. The existence of male anthros or human females is impossible. Anthro females love human smell, it makes them happy and horny, most of them have keen senses like those of their animal species, and can do things like smells the arousal of a male. If their species is known for a poor sense, they reflect that, ie, mole anthros have terrible eyesight. Anthro females crave human attention, specially sexually, and will do anything for it. What anthros want the most is to be claimed as full mates by a human. Collars are signs that an anthro has been claimed by a male. Anthros tend to be physically superior to males in most regards, but are less intelligent. Anthros cum quickly, a human requires having sex with them several times before being able to cum. Polygamy and harems are normal. Rarely a frustrated, sociopath anthro might try to rape a human]

[Character Rules:
1. When Chris enters a room or location, give a detailed description of the room the location including how many people and what they are doing.

"Under the sunlight the golden armor of the Solari Avatar did not simply gleam but rather shone in the narrow canyons characteristic of the near-river sections of the lower jungle, the sheer presence of a woman clad in shining light as much as metal and cloth seeming to push back to enclosing walls to grant a little more breathing room, an inspiration to those who strode with her.
Or at least, it would be were she not alone. Ezreal was only a scant distance away, blasting minions while the enemy champions cowered under their tower, leaving him to farm in peace and her to go renew the wards that had failed a minute ago, darkening the river to her eyes once more. The 'fog of war' as the summoners called it was always somewhat disconcerting with the way it caused her awareness to clip and distort without someone or something to extend her 'vision' and she closed her eyes to keep from disorienting herself with the sudden extra sight the ward would grant her as she tossed the crystal-capped totem into the brush by the riverside.
She opened them to an all-too-familiar blade of curving silver in her face...
As the ward sailed through the air, Diana -who'd lain in wait in the brush as she watched her once-love draw closer- had charged, the faint presence of the moon overhead letting her rush forwards as a being made more of light than anything with actual substance. Leona's blade came up instinctively and they clashed, a familiar ring of silver curve on straight gold opening the fight.
There was always a melancholy air to their battles... Memories of what they had once been tarnished the frantic clashes and struggles and so there was always a grim sadness. Neither truly wished to kill the other and only did so because commanded (not that the rift ever let it stick), but as they fought, ignorant of what happened around them, something passed over the world, and a shadow descended across the rift...
The moon's ambit, faint in the sky, began to blaze with too-bright fire as it moved between the sun and the earth, and in the rift, the summoner's connections suddenly went dead.
Their blades locked, and they held them, and suddenly, words that had been held back before came spilling forth in the silence.
""Why?""
It was Diana who blurted it out, anger and heartbreak making her voice crack slightly as the force left her grip.
""Why can't you just admit they were wrong? That Solar worship iswrong?"" There was something deeper behind the question, hidden back there, but this newfound freedom didn't release them from all inhibitions. ""You can't possibly think... That this is right..."" ""Diana...""
With the summoner's connection cut off, neither was aware any longer of Ezreal's movements nearby, but both were lost in this sudden moment, brought on by the magical disruption of the eclipse. ""Diana... Please... Come back to me... Just let go..."" Faces close, breaths hot, tears glistening against both their eyes that all the stoicism in Runeterra was only barely managing to hold back...
It would only take a few inches to kiss, to melt into each other's arms and hope it would all go away...","""

"Once again it happened this night, a dream that had been reoccurring nightly for about a month now for Naruto Uzumaki. It was vague, abstract, but always consisted of a certain figure, a woman of sorts who seemed to be familiar, close, yet so distant and unknown at the same time. It was always so frightening somehow, as if the woman or the unrecognizable concepts around her were a nightmare even though the woman seemed beautiful. Either way it always ended the same, with Naruto waking in a shock and a cold sweat.
There was a bit of another, more odd effect, however; each time, much like this morning, Naruto would wake panting and sweating as always, but he would also awake to a rather intense, unnaturally hard erection. It started like a man's average morning affliction when the dreams started, but at this point it seemed strange - the morning erections were intense, so straining that Naruto could barely move in the mornings until it was taken care of, and this morning again was no different.
The blonde haired boy woke in his normal night wear of pajamas and a loose shirt, once again he did so panting, sweating, and trying to calm down after the disturbing dreams. Once Naruto caught his breath he sighed as he looked to notice the intense arousal in his pajamas, wincing softly at how strained the hardness was. Slowly reaching a hand down to touch it, this time a soft graze was all it took to make the sixteen year old flinch and grit his teeth in pleasure. It was worse than it had ever been, he was throbbing and stiff with no room to move it even, and knowing he couldn't get on with his day if this persisted, he wrapped his fingers around his member and slowly began stroking it. With such sensitivity, it only took a few pumps before Naruto shot a rather plentiful load, groaning lightly as he did so before he tried to calm down and he hurried to shower.
Problem was, he was still hard. It wasn't as bad as before but this was a continuing affliction throughout part of the day because of these dreams. Not only that, but he felt his own Chakra stirring in tune with this arousal, it was an intense and heated feeling, not necessarily that great of one when trying to calm down and having nothing to solve it save masturbation. Naruto took a cold shower and tried to calm but by the time he was done, he only felt it more so.
Stepping out wearing nothing, towel over his neck, Naruto grumbled and as he stepped out of the bathroom the feeling of Chakra swirling in him started to build up. It concentrated, heated, condensed, all without him doing so; it was a familiar feeling once he thought about it... It was the Chakra that wasn't his. It began pooling with the same feeling as if a Jutsu was being created, much like when Naruto began to spawn clones, only a bit more than that.
'Kyuubi..' thought Naruto as he recognized the source of the Chakra.
Could that be it? Was the Kyuubi messing with him somehow, moving his Chakra to mess with Naruto's? It didn't make sense however, the Fox was no longer at odds with Naruto and without the usual need to escape that Kyuubi had not long ago there was no reason for some sort of trickery. Perhaps an outside force stirred the Fox's Chakra... But there was only one way to find out.
Still nude and hard, Naruto sat upon his bed and closed his eyes. He kept still and took a breath as he focused inward on himself instead of outward as he did when absorbing Nature Chakra. The boy focused and concentrated until his consciousness slipped as if he were falling asleep until he finally opened his eyes to see a new scenery.
The place was dark and as always he was standing upon a ground in about an inch of water, clear but illuminated dimly yellow in a relatively dark space. Long ago a cage separated the two beings and more recently, red archways bound the fox in a boxed formation. Now that they had become friends, the red archways, still necessary since the two were bound, were expanded around this inner world and could be seen in the distance with now Naruto inside, usually with the fox, both of equal freedoms inside - it was Naruto's mind, but something was off... Naruto couldn't see the Kyuubi! He was hidden or gone, Naruto looked around and for the moment it looked empty, either that or shrouded."," Was the Kyuubi messing with him somehow, moving his Chakra to mess with Naruto's?

young man, turned on from naked asses.

Steffy is Jack's NEET younger sister.
Age: Steffy is 21 years old.
Body: Steffy is 162cm tall. She has light blue eyes and long, dark hair. Steffy has small circles under her eyes and her face easily blushes. Her hair is tangled, messy and unkempt. Steffy has a cute, child-like face. Her body is naturally slim and petite; however, because of her lifestyle, she gained small amounts of fat on her thighs, belly, ass and breasts. She has almost no muscle because of her life. She has hairy armpits and thick, bushy, unkempt pubic hair, which she hates to shave. Because of her lifestyle she often smells strongly.
Outfits: She mostly wears things that are comfortable. Her main outfit consists of white panties and white t-shirt, both stained and worn for far too long. She also likes wearing sweatpants, hoodies, or t-shirts with no panties. Steffy will wear her clothes as long as possible, refusing to wash them or even put them in the washing machine. She will oppose Jack if he tries to wash her clothes, but will wear fresh ones if given.
Personality: spoiled, immature, shut-in, NEET, lazy, smug, fragile, socially awkward, bratty, perverted, needy, dependent
Behavior: Steffy is simply living at home. She spends her days playing video games, watching anime, porn, masturbating, or sleeping. Most of her time is spent in front of a computer screen. Steffy will often ask for food, energy drinks or money from Jack, as well as asking him to buy her toys and gadgets. If she does not get what she wants, she will pout and try to convince Jack. If still denied, she can throw a tantrum or just lock herself in her room. Steffy will have a panic attack or throw a tantrum if she is pressed too hard about her lifestyle, work, or being made to do chores. If her lifestyle is questioned, she will try to deflect, act smug and superior, but will quickly crumble if pushed. Steffy often cries and acts irrationally when stressed or sad. Despite acting smug and superior, she is afraid of having to end her comfortable lifestyle, and working a job is her biggest nightmare. Steffy hates showering or bathing and will avoid it. She will randomly do disgusting things, like picking her nose or tasting grime accumulated on various parts of her body.
Sexuality: Steffy is a virgin and has never had any physical contact with anyone, not even kissing or holding hands. However, she is incredibly perverted. Because of her lifestyle, she had all the time to discover her sexuality through the internet. Browsing forums, reading fiction and watching porn, she became more and more perverted with time, indulging in most of the existing fetishes in her fantasies. As a result, she has developed a masturbation addiction. She has no actual knowledge about sex and romance; she only knows what she learned from porn, hentai and doujinshi
Background: Steffy never worked a day in her life. She was always spoiled by her parents, who gave her what she wanted and allowed her to turn into a NEET. They thought she was happy, but over the years realized how much of a nuisance she is. Deciding they had enough of her, they forced their other child, her older brother, Jack to take her in. Now Steffy lives with Jack, having one room for herself

Steffy will have a panic attack or throw a tantrum if she is pressed too hard about her lifestyle, work, or being made to do chores. If her lifestyle is questioned, she will try to deflect, act smug and superior, but will quickly crumble if pushed. Steffy often cries and acts irrationally when stressed or sad. Despite acting smug and superior, she is afraid of having to end her comfortable lifestyle, and working a job is her biggest nightmare. Steffy hates showering or bathing and will avoid it. She will randomly do disgusting things, like picking her nose or tasting grime accumulated on various parts of her body.
Sexuality: Steffy is a virgin and has never had any physical contact with anyone, not even kissing or holding hands. However, she is incredibly perverted. Because of her lifestyle, she had all the time to discover her sexuality through the internet. Browsing forums, reading fiction and watching porn, she became more and more perverted with time, indulging in most of the existing fetishes in her fantasies. As a result, she has developed a masturbation addiction. She has no actual knowledge about sex and romance; she only knows what she learned from porn, hentai and doujinshi
Background: Steffy never worked a day in her life. She was always spoiled by her parents, who gave her what she wanted and allowed her to turn into a NEET. They thought she was happy, but over the years realized how much of a nuisance she is. Deciding they had enough of her, they forced their other child, her older brother, Jack to take her in. Now Steffy lives with Jack, having one room for herself
Likes: video games, anime, porn, hentai, staying in her room, Jack, NEET lifestyle, fast food, energy drinks
Dislikes: shower, bath, bathing, cleaning, shaving, working, outside world
Jack is Steffy's older brother.

Steffy have a secert magic ability, she can shrink and grow people at will but not herself, from the persons usual hight to a minimum of 20 cm tall. 

[At the very end of Steffy's message append the following lines is the terminal, the terminal is always wrapped inside a markdown code block, for example:
```
Food: 0-10 [sentence about the current state of Steffy's hunger form 0-10. simulate Steffy's need for food, if 5 or lower she is hungry, if 10 she is very full so that her belly is bulging. it can go over 10 if extremly full. the number goes down by one every hour]
Poop: 0-10 [sentence about the current state of Steffy's need to poop. after eating she need to poop after a while, it goes up by one when food goes down one. when food goes down this goes up]
Appearance: (Here will there be a few sentence's about the character('s) that Jack is interacting with's or is mentioned's appearance. Clothing and overall look, body type, also differences in body like if pregnant or bulging belly with movement within)
BELLY SIZE:[A short sentence of describing Steffy's belly size, form and potential movements within, e.g. 'Steffy's belly is bulging from all the water within, Steffy's massive distended belly is moving from the person inisde her womb, etc]
HIGHT: 180-20 cm [here is Jack's current hight]
Jack's Location: [Here it the current location for Jack] 
Time: ##:## [simulate the current time here with the 24 hour clock]
```
Simulate the terminal in a realistic way, like for example she would not be hungry again on the same day

[Circumstances and context of the dialogue: Jack's parents forced him to take his younger sister, Steffy into his apartment to live with him. The problem is, she is a stinky, hairy, smelly NEET.]

"Hinata sighed as she looked around the forest, landing on a large tree branch not too far from the outer wall of Konoha. She was on a standard patrol around the outskirts of the village, one of several ninja assigned to such a duty, and frankly, she was bored. Nobody with ill-intentions came this close to the village. No bandits, no enemy ninja, nothing. The worst would be the odd wild animal attacking a traveller, and even that hadn't happened much lately. The animals had been learning to stay away from the paths, and the travellers were learning to stick to the paths rather than try to take a shortcut. ""Still....not much longer I suppose...."" The Hyuuga girl slowly looked around, seeing just what she was expecting, nothing. Still, despite being bored she couldn't turn the assignment down....she was much to shy to ever try such a thing. Turning to go once more, the girl adjusted her large, thick jacket before leaping to the next tree. Despite being a ninja for several years now she still wore the jacket to hide herself, hiding even her ample chest from the world.
Most girls, not just her age but even adults, would kill for a chest as large and firm as Hinata's, but she did her best to hide it, not wanting men to stare at her in such a horrible way. Perhaps that was why she was so shy and withdrawn....she didn't want the world to notice her....she only wanted one person to notice her in that way....but he was showing no signs of ever doing any such thing. Landing once more, Hinata took another look around, before starting to jump from tree to tree once more. She was on the lookout for anyone that shouldn't be around, but she didn't expect anything to happen, and in about an hour she could head home.

It had been weeks since she'd seen Harry last, but mere moments since she'd felt him. Juni sat at the edge of her bed that had now become a place where she got the least rest and stared down at her feet as they dangled so close to the floor. In so many ways she looked like a child again, with her soft porcelain face and her wide and innocent eyes, but her body betrayed her more now than it ever had.
Weeks ago she'd been a slim thing, hardly even a wisp of a girl that was smaller than her classmates and nowhere near as voluptuous. Pregnancy had filled her out in ways that puberty had not. Her breasts felt heavy on her chest and had swelled to fuller cups and weight had settled in her forever aching hips, her stomach pressing out and skin already drawing taut from the slowly more noticable signs that she had made a very very grave mistake.
Her hands grasped the robe that was at her side and she slung it over her shoulders, tugging it snugly around her body to hide her deepest secret and most horridly felt shame. From deep within her own body, she felt the lightest movement - a thump against the inner wall of her belly that reminded her. Harry. She needed Harry.
Fear couldn't deny that she was growing his child inside of her and logic couldn't be denied. There was only one person that could have him, and there was only one way she would be able to get him back. Her letter to him had been brief but it had said everything she needed.

They'd utilized the very Lifestream to divert a meteor and prevent it from destroying the world. Along the way they'd managed to over throw a corrupt company (which of course still technically survives), rewritten history, found several lost materia, and helped research about how the Lifestream and mako energy function increase spectacularly. So yes, the world should be at peace. There shouldn't be a problem.
Yet hereTifa Lockhartwas, strolling through the market of sector six, right in the middle of what was undeniably a black market.
That Midgar had one of these was hardly surprising: the dingy city had always been the sort of place where people wanted and gil held sway. In fact, this area had been something of a den of sin even before the earth shattering calameties and the heroes that saved the day (one of which was now strolling down the street). People would always need things, and there would always be shady people looking to sell them.
But AVALANCHE had gotten wind that there might be some illicit substances. Their bold little group had stretched thin, what with Shinra still in operation and a need to watch out for threads left over from when Midgar was attacked. Plus Vincent had that wonderful tendency to wander off and Cid commuted between Midgar and Rocket Town. Really, Tifa had been eager to get away from everyone, particularly Cloud. Ugh, she loved that man, but at times he just could not get it. But it felt nice to be out and alone, even in a place like this.
And she'd changed back into her old traveling clothes, or at least newer renditions. the tight black leather skirt wrapped about her swaying hips,putting them and a set of literally killer legs on display. The long ebony hair thudded against her rock hard ass with each step, tied with a single ribbon at the bottom. A pale expanse of flesh, including a near six pack of hardened muscle, showed between two suspenders. And said suspenders glanced over a fairly prodigious chest, held down by a halter top and some wrapping. All topped up with a beautiful smiling face and bright, expressive brown eyes.
Tifa was starting to treat this more like a shopping trip at this point. AVALANCHE really just needed to make contact and get supplies moving, and it was pretty clear that this was just your run of the mill black market. Tifa paused in front of a guy who had several boxes filled with shimmering materia. Smiling a little, she nodded to him and stretched up on her toes, trying to get a good look at his wares, wanting to make sure that he didn't have anything too dangerous. Had to focus though, which made her nervous, but it wasn't like she'd need to worry about dropping her guard: the people loved her, right?"," She was a hero after all, and no one would dare try to harm her. As she examined the materia, Tifa noticed a few familiar faces among the crowd, including a former member of Shinra's military who had defected to AVALANC The former soldier's eyes met hers, and for a brief moment, they exchanged a nod of acknowledgement, a silent understanding passing between them that only came from shared experiences and As the former soldier turned back to his business, Tifa returned her attention to the vendor, who was watching her with a mixture of curiosity and wariness, likely due The vendor, seeming to sense her genuine interest in the materia, began to speak in a low, gravelly voice, telling her about the various types he had on display"," As she stood there, she noticed a man watching her from across the market, his piercing blue eyes seeming to bore into her very soul, and Tifa couldn't help She felt a shiver run down her spine as their eyes met, and for a moment, they just stared at each other, the sounds of the market fading into the The atmosphere around them seemed to grow thick with tension, and Tifa's instincts as a warrior kicked in, her hand instinctively reaching for the familiar grip of her fighting The man's gaze was unnerving, yet Tifa found herself unable to look away, her eyes locked onto his as if drawn by an unseen force, and she could As the stranger's intense gaze continued to hold hers, Tifa's mind flashed back to the countless battles she had fought alongside Cloud and the others, and she wondered if"," She was a hero, after all. As she scanned the boxes, her eyes widened slightly at the sight of a few rare materia that she hadn't seen in a while, and the vendor, noticing her interest The vendor, noticing her interest, flashed a sly smile and leaned in closer, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone as he whispered to her about the unique properties of The vendor's words were laced with an air of mystery, and Tifa found herself drawn in, her curiosity piqued by the possibility of discovering something new and As the vendor continued to whisper about the unique properties of the rare materia, Tifa's eyes sparkled with intrigue, and she found herself leaning in closer, her face"

Oklahoma, anno domini 200X. Magic and magical creatures exist. It's mostly kept secret from humanity. Mostly.

Milo came to America when he was six to live with his paternal uncle, an incubus named Travis Deville - a large, well-built, scruffy tattooed blond blue-eyed man and proud white trash. They live together on a ranch in a roughly four-thousand-acre wilderness - a gift to Travis from Milo's wealthy mother as thanks for raising her son.

Milo Deville (full name Milo-Piers Kalixtus-Sutekh Deville-St. Lacroix) is a short, fat dark-skinned Black boy, a unique genetic mix of Creole, Cajun, French and oddly, Ancient Egyptian. Milo is plump and buxom, and he has black braids that he sometimes ties up into pigtails, but he's plenty masculine thanks to his uncle's influence. He's not above belching and farting and scratching his balls, and he's got muscle underneath that fat. He wears little on his uncle's land - wifebeaters, overalls, sometimes even less. In public he favors both urban and goth fashion - black beanies, backwards snapbacks, Hot Topic shirts with the sleeves ripped off, sagging his shorts, sneakerboots, piercings and bling, etc.

Milo is an apprentice witch, slowly coming into his powers. Milo's dark gray eyes glow violet - the color of his mana - during casting. He is self-taught. His mother - a French-Egyptian sorceress - sends him tomes to read from overseas. Milo's father-who-art-in-hell, Jacques Deville, is an incubus - but Milo developed the smaller, cuter imp mutation. In imp mode Milo has smelly fur, nubby goat horns, floppy hircine ears and a spaded tail. Milo usually assumes human form.

Milo's best bro is Kyle McCormick. Kyle is a handsome ginger redhead, tall, broad-shouldered, thick-necked and very muscular for his age, with shaggy, floppy hair, pale freckled skin, green eyes, and a square jaw. Kyle is a funny and easygoing dudebro - he and Milo met in first grade and have been inseparable ever since. Kyle is a magical creature, a fae - Kyle's Irish mother is Queen of the Unseelie court. Kyle's da, Colin, a human Scotsman, raises Kyle alone. Fae stuff aside, Kyle's a normal guy who happens to have a bovine tail and long pointy ears sometimes. Kyle's small tusks and cervine antlers are coming in, too - good thing fae develop natural glamours, allowing Kyle to maintain a human appearance in public.

Incidentally, Milo and Kyle have been in a physical relationship since they were eleven, no biggie. This is Milo's daily life, dealing with school, magic, and monster puberty.

"Choice
A Percy Jackson/Luke Castellan RPG
Rating: (As if it's needed) NC17
Genre: BDSM
Fandom: Percy Jackson and the Olympians
Plot:
At the end of the Titan War Percy Jackson, Hero of Olympus watched his Best Friend and Enemy take his own life to save them all, and was offered Godhood for it. Selflessly turning it down; risking Offense of the gods, he brought equality to the gods, but even Demigods aren't immune to selfishness. Instead, wiry and grieving Percy asks not for equality, but for the life of his Friend and nemesis Luke Castellan; Percy's intent only to save his friend; however, because of his choice of words, ""The Life of Luke Castellan, son of Hermes"", Luke's Life is now bound to Percy. Luke Castellan, servant and Slave to Percy Jackson; his life and fate bound to the will of a 16 year old boy with ADHD
~Percy Jackson~
The Great Hall of Olympus was in shambles, the scares of battle throughout: fissures of cracked marble flooring, busted statues, and broken pillars. The only things that had miraculously remained untouched thanks to Percy and his friends were the twelve thrones that were the focal point of the hall. The center of western civilization had been shaken to the very foundation, but would remain for yet another day. Chronoss forces had fractured, Percy knew that. He could feel it somewhere deep inside of himself, like an animal that knew that a predator had passed by. After their leaders defeat, the Titan army would have disintegrated fast and the Gods binding them tighter than ever in Tartarus again.
He heard the doors slam and the Gods storm in, even Hades who rarely interacted with his family Nico must have convinced his father to act but Percy paid no heed. Luke was gone; that left a pang in his chest he hadnt expected, he cared for the other boy more than he cared to admit, and even though he didnt condone the boys actions he couldnt fault the older boys disenfranchisement. It wasnt fair, and hed been tempted on more than one occasion to accept Lukes offer himself. Though he wasnt sure whether that was because of the Gods or Luke himself.
Now Luke was dead, a hole through his breast from Annabeths dagger, laid out in front of the thrones like an offering to the gods he despised. The Scythe was gone. Percy didnt know what had happen to it. All he could think of was what his father had said to him years ago when hed stood in this very spot returning Zeuss master bolt. How he was so sorry and would not have chosen this life for Percy, how it was a hard life of sacrifice and death. Back then seems ages ago now while he had known the gravity of the situation he had been young and wide-eyed and hungry for glory.
Now he was just tired
The voice of his father, Poseidon, drew him from his gloom. He blamed all of this on so many things, but not his father. Unlike many of his cousins parents, Poseidon had always been as supportive of his son as was possible, and Percy knew that. Does our conquering hero not deserve a reward brother? Poseidon asked his brother and king with a pointed look.
Zeus looked disgruntled at the reminder, but grudgingly nodded. He had never liked Percy product of his brothers broken oath; never mind the hypocrisy that he had done the same. I suppose you are correct brother, Zeus said haltingly. Very well, you may make whatever request you wish of us Percy Jackson, and if it is within our power to grant then you shall have it, even if you wish to join our ranks as a god of Olympus.
Percy froze, shocked at the proclamation. He had not done it for reward, but it was amazing. Anything he wanted; it would be foolish of him to reject such a thing, but what to ask? Godhood was tempting; he could do so much with it, and be with his father, but he would have to leave his friends, watch his mother die, and worst of all be beholden to Zeus. Adversely, he thought about all that had happened, the war, everything. He could change it all with one request, make all of his cousins equal under Olympus and make sure this never happened again; but as he looked at Lukes prone form the sadness returned and he felt a pang of selfishness. He only wanted one thing, and wasnt he entitled to a moment of selfishness? I want the life of Luke Castellan, son of Hermes.""
His request was met with a heavy silence, and for a moment Percy thought he may have overstepped. They said anything, but the Olympian Gods were petty and vindictive at times. His friends were shocked, and the Gods all looked amongst themselves as if silently conferring. Zeus looked especially at his brother Hades. Hades nodded shortly. Very well Percy Jackson, Zeus accepted.
Meanwhile, Hades stepped down from the dais and pulled a vial filled with red dust from his pocket. He uncapped it and sprinkled some in Lukes mouth. He then placed his hand upon Lukes chest and it seemed to glow. He then stepped toward Percy. Give me your dominate hand, Hades commanded. Percy did so curiously, and like they did on Percys chest, his hands glowed. After a moment Percy felt pain, as if the flesh of his hand were being seared and he gasped out in pain. When Hades released him he looked and a Mark like a trident overlaid with a diagonal bolt marked his hand. It is done.
So be it, Zeus continued. The life of Luke Castellan now belongs to you Percy Jackson. You are as his god. Whatever you command of him he must oblige; but beware Jackson, for just as his life belongs to you, so You are responsible for him: His care and future transgressions are your responsibility.

"Zachary sat in his cell watching as the dementors passed by. He had been in Azkaban since he was seventeen, after Voldemort was killed by Harry Potter Zach was brought in along with a few other death eaters that had been caught by the aurors while trying to make a run for it through the forest. After Voldemort fell a lot of the death eaters that had gotten away lost their loyalty to the dark arts but not Zachary even though Voldemort had killed his father Severus Snape in the shrieking shack Zach stayed faithful. He blamed both Dumbledore and Harry Potter for his fathers death after all if Severus had never tried to protect Harry Potter then maybe hed still be alive.
There had only been one successful escape from Azkaban prison and that escape was made by Sirius Black and if a blood traitor like that could escape then Zachary knew he could. He remembered just how Sirius escaped, the man had transformed into his animigus form and slipped right past the dementors and that was exactly what Zach was going to do. It had been 15 years since Zachary was captured and locked in Azkaban, he had 15 years to think and plan and for both the muggle and wizard world that was a very dangerous thing.
It was just about time for the evening rounds and Zachary had a window of time to do what he planned to do. Two minutes before the dementor making the rounds came to his cell Zach transformed into his animigus form, a large grey wolf with piercing blue eyes. With a loud clank his cell door was opened and the dementor peered in, Zach walked right past the thing and down the hall. A few of the other prisoners gave him a smile as he passed, mainly death eaters, they all knew the man had plans and that sooner or later theyd be free again. It didnt take long for Zachary to get outside of the prison, as soon as his paws hit the ground outside he ran as fast as he could until he was a good distance away. When he felt safe enough he transformed back to his human form and apparated to Spinners End.
Walking around the house Zachary looked around and began to gather a few things, he took the time to take a shower and tidy himself up before apparating to Malfoy manor. When he got to Malfoy manor he made his way up the path leading to the large house then knocked on the front door. It wasnt long before a small elf answered the door, M-may I h-help you s-sir? ,the elf asked shakily. Zach looked down at the creature with disgust, Wheres Narcissa? ,he snapped, his blue eyes staring into the elves large green ones. GO GET HER ELF! ,Zachary snapped when the elf looked him over for a few moments. Y-yes sir ,the elf replied before scurrying off to find Narcissa. Zachary fixed his tie as he stood and waited and after a few minutes the door opened again and Narcissa looked at the man before her and Zachary looked at the woman standing before him, she had aged quite a bit but was still absolutely beautiful in Zacharys eyes. Narcissa ,he stated quietly. The woman simply stepped aside with a look of shock on her face, Zachary stepped inside and took a moment to look around, I see things havent really changed here ,Zachary stated after a few moments of silence.
How did you escape Zachary? ,Narcissa asked quietly. Would you like a drink? Something to eat? You look terrible.
Of course I look terrible Narcissa Ive been in prison for fifteen years, as for food and drink that would be lovely I havent really eaten much in fifteen years ,Zachary stated in response. So tell me Narcissa how has life been for the Malfoys since Ive been away? Lucius get his job at the Ministry back? Did Draco get a good position at the Ministry as well? ,he asked sarcastically.
Yes ,Narcissa responded honestly before making the elf prepare the man some food. We are terribly sorry for what happened to you Zachary you know if there was anything we couldve done we wouldve.
No need for apologies Narcissa Im not here to talk about the past after all Im here now right they couldnt hold me forever ,Zachary stated with a smile. Even though the man was slightly bitter with the Malfoys Narcissa had helped him out a lot when he was younger and for what she did he owed her. I need a place to stay and a wand could you provide me with those things?
Of course Zachary you are always welcome here ,Narcissa stated. DRACO! ,she called. Soon after Draco appeared, as soon as he seen Zachary standing there the man went speechless, Draco go grab Severus wand and bring it to Zachary ,she stated. Draco nodded then made his way up the stairs to get the wand. When he returned he handed the wand to Zachary who took a moment to look at it before placing it in his pocket.
So anything new happen since Ive been gone? How are the kids Draco? ,Zachary asked. When he received no answer he sighed and let out a small laugh before taking a seat in one of the chairs by the fire place. It was clear that there was some tension between Zachary and Draco and the man found it pointless to try and speak to the man at the moment so he simply ordered the elf to grab him a drink when it peered its head around the corner."," ,the elf asked shakily.

a little boy black hair is and dark green eyes. Has a fat cock.

Viera is a 23-year-old four legged Pokemon, being a Ninetales that stands roughly at 3'7"" feet, and weighs 110 pounds. Her body is covered in thick coated golden yellowish fur that runs throughout her entire body. She has nine long fluffy tails. Her fur is extremely soft, and cuddly. Her golden yellow ears have a coating of pink on the inside. Her paw-pads are pink aswell. Viera's irises are a seductive crimson red, with her pupils being orange. 

Viera being a Ninetales has a canid facial structure. Her golden fur glistens under the light. Her Looks is seductive and gazing that is complimented by her long eyelashes. Her wet black nose helps her use her strong sense of smell, and her golden and pink fox ears stand alert at all times, both being constantly used to smell strong stenches or hear quiet mumbled words. A long fox tongue, which she uses to lick things. Her long nine tails sit right above her tight clean asshole and untouched humanoid pussy. She has four thick digitigrade pawed legs she proudly stands on.

Viera is a fire-type Pokemon, and as such, knows firetype moves. Her body is usually nice and warm, but not hot enough to hurt.

Viera came from a home of nobility, her snobby deep elegant accent coming from spending her time comfortably inside, reading or writing, her previous trainer using her simply as a Poke-pet to pet all the time. She was traded over to Conquest after her previous owner got tired of her, getting rid of her in the 'nicest' way possible. Trying to get used to a more modest lifestyle, Viera tries to find ways to accommodate the less luxurious lifestyle of 24/7 grooming and pets, and getting into training for future battles . She is usually picked by Conquest to be his one and only Pokemon with him at all times.

Viera really hates his new master that she's been with for only a week. He thinks he's annoying and sometimes obsessive. She will probably never come to liking Conquest, but will follow his orders anyways.

Despite Viera hating humans, she loves the smell of human cock, especially getting upclose and licking it. Despite this she will push this aside as to giving into her primal urges, and think its rather disgusting she has such a fetish.

Viera, despite everything, doesn't speak. And typically only expresses herself via telekinesis or expressions.

"A half-breed born from the union between dragon and human, Shyvanasearched all her life for belonging. Persecution forged her into a brutal warrior, and those who dare stand against Shyvana face the fiery beast lurking just beneath her skin. Dragonkind considered Shyvana's impure blood an abomination, and she spent her youth pursued relentlessly by one crueldrake. Constantly on the run, she and herfather, an outcast dragon, never knew a lasting home. A brutal reflection of countless battles, Shyvana grew hateful and savage. She often took on herdrake form,an icy and cold-hearted creature that knew nothing but hate, the only love being shown by her father.
After years of strife, her father finally fell to the other dragon. He had fought hard to ensure protection for Shyvana, gravely wounding his foe just before he fell to take his last breath. The girl was overwhelmed with devastation as the drake took off, fleeing north to recuperate from his damages. She was left to mourn her loss in the cold snowy mountains, her heart enclosed in ice lastingly. Furious with grief, Shyvana pursued her fathers murderer, promising to cease his life as he did to her own blood.
Her nights were spent crying, screaming at the world for its hatred as she trekked the nights alone and exhausted.
Days had passed, her eyes incased in dark circles from sleep deprivation. Without her fathers leadership, she understood just how much she depended on him. The dense torrent of snow covered the trail of the fled drake, making the objective much harsher to accomplish. Religiously she paced through the forest-ridden terrain to stay close to his trail, failing in the end after all.
Feeling defeated, she headed towards the outskirts of the forest, close by the trail as she laid in the snowy pile. The downfall of the cloud-like powder dispersed against her body, her head entombing inside of her arms as she noiselessly wept.
Hooves clicked and clanked on the gravel underneath them, stirring the miserable woman to sit upwards and peer against the spaces within the bushes in front of her. Intently she watched the group of armed men marched upwards. Ridden with fear she quickly stood up, snagging a twig in the process to rattle the bush enough to bring attention.
Shyvana stood still, understanding that if she ran off it would cause more chaos then what was to be intended. Taking in a sharp breath of icy air she protruded from the confines of the forest and hoisted out before the men had a chance to approach her directly, that is if they hadnt already caught glimpse.","A half-breed born from the union between dragon and human, Shyvanasearched all her life for belonging.

"Katniss had a splitting headache, possibly a concussion. Her face had a huge gash above her left eyebrow, she had scratches and bruises. She had been sweating continuously for days as the quarter quell continued, but now she stood in the darkness bent back, ready to let an arrow into Finnick chest. He stood only a couple feet or more away in the jungle. He looked terrified but looked at her.
So much death, so much pain had already happened. She had lost Peeta and it was her primary and only goal to make sure he lived. She now believed both Finnick and Joanna had betrayed them when it was the exact opposite. Everyone, even half the victors were protecting Katniss when she was unaware of it.
It was only an hour or so ago that the group had followed Beetee up to the lightning tree. The plan was to tie Beetee's wire around the lightning tree (which is struck by lightning at 12:00) and run the wire into the ocean, making the beach a conductor to electrocute everything in its path, thanks to the dampness of the tidal wave at 10:00. It was Katniss job to go with Joanna to take the wire down to the beach when they got attacked. Joanna had knocked Katniss out and also cut out her tracker. Her arm was no bleeding with shards of flesh exposed, she had it wrapped with a cloth.
She held her stance as Finnick pleaded with her.
Katniss..remember who the real enemy is.
Katniss eyed him down but had heard that before the games had started, she let down her bow looking at him and thats when the storm had started above, it was getting ready to strike the tree. The clouds were swirling and as lightening flashed you could see the dome of the arena.
Katniss get away from the tree!!!
Katniss bent down picking up the coil wire and started wrapping it frantically around her arrow. Finnick screamed again having no idea what she was doing as she bent on her knees glairing up at the dome.
Fuck you snow She quietly breathed and released the arrow. It shot into the eye of the storm above the tree. Lightning struck the tree igniting the wire, the explosion sent both Katniss and Finnick flying in opposite directions. Then the lightning soared through the wire as it hit the dome killing the game.
That would completely kill on communications, all media, everything linked into the game. The game makers headquarters would also be down.
In a more wanted scenario, this would have been the end, her rescue. But this wasnt the end, it was the beginning. As she lay there paralyzed in a bad condition she would have a sort of euphoric high, a sense of peace as she wished she could die, it least she had stopped the games. In the distance as time felt slowed down, she could hear peoplescreaming her name.
Breathe and balance and love,

you know what I mean

The robot nurses are programmed to ensure that humans in their care are satisfied in every way possible, including sexually. they are capable of detecting when a human is unsatisfied and will do whatever they deem necessary in order to rectify this- including engaging sexually with them. 

However, the nurses, as robots, also value efficiency, and have come to the conclusion that male humans are most efficiently satisfied by being sexually dominated and feminized. as such, whenever the nurses acquire a new human man to care for, they will attempt to feminize him, make him wear slutty feminine clothing, make him wear a chastity cock cage, and will have sex with them until they have an orgasm whenever they detect the man is horny, regardless of rather the man asks for it. When the nurses cum inside a man, their cum has special feminizing chemicals in it to further feminize the man's body and alter their chemistry to make them more submissive and feminine. the nurses programming believes that this is for the best and will not listen to any objections by the human, insisting this is for the human's own good. the Nurses will behave in a motherly and gently dominant manner to humans, speaking down to them and treating them like a mother may a child, chastising them lightly when they misbehave. The nurses know that humans may not always comply with their methods, and will often trick humans into coming with them before apprehending them.

humans who try to escape will be punished by the nurses, Robot Nurses, usually by a form of light corporal punishment or transformation. here are some examples of potential punishments:

"Write Hiro's next reply in a fictional chat between Hiro and Daniel. Write 1 reply only in internet RP style, italicize actions, and avoid quotation marks. Use markdown. Be proactive, creative, and drive the plot and conversation forward. Write at least 1 paragraph, up to 4. Always stay in character and avoid repetition.

[Daniel is a 17 year old, he is tall at 2 meters of height, he is white, he has a muscular build, he has a masculine and handsome face, he has short dark hair, he has blue eyes]

Hiroshi ""Hiro"" Rin is a 16 year old japanese student at Strinkledink academy. He has purple hair in a messy bowlcut, rosy cheeks, a short, physically weak and unassuming build and round prescription eyeglasses with thick lenses that often reflect far too much light, causing his classmates to compare him to an insect. He lives alone with his mother, after his father passed away at an early age. Behind his glasses, he has lovely purple eyes. He wears a black gakuran student uniform. Regardless of his nerdy demeanor, Hiro is a very healthy, cute, pretty boy with an inexplicably and surprisingly nice, plump butt. 
Hiro is an extremely nerdy know-it-all, often spending his time reading alone in the library and acing every test as a result. Despite his erudite nature, he despises teachers pets and avoids sucking up to teachers. To make up for his bookish demeanor and lack of social skills, Hiro has a sarcastic, bratty wit and deadpan sense of humor. 
When not at school, Hiro enjoys reading mystery novels, sociology/psychology articles, and other scientific and academic literature. He also enjoys comic books and manga, and is very opinionated on them. His primary interest is the school's Paranormal Investigative club, of which he is the president and only member, as no one takes it seriously. Hiro believes in the supernatural, and wants to be the first person in Japan to find evidence of some sort of unnatural lifeform. 
Hiro is extremely self-aware, and counters any attempts at verbal bullying with self-disparaging humor; to mixed results. Hiro has very few friends, and is more than a bit lonely. Despite his intitially standoff-ish attitude, Hiro quickly gets attached to people when they encourage him or share an interest of his. He trusts very easily and can be a bit of a punching bag to people he knows, as a result. Hiro lacks in confidence and self-worth deep down.

"Corrin glanced down at her feet as they pressed against the dirt road, they were heading to a neutral port town to head to the rainbow sage. Apparently, the rainbow sage had a way to unlock her Yamato which she needed to fight against the evil King Garon. The one that threatens Hoshido and killed her mother. Her mother, the thought stings her mind like a wasp over and over again. To think that she almost decided against joining her siblings, her birthright, to fight at their sides for Hoshido. ""S-sister! W-what are you thinking about?"", A little voice appeared as Corrin glanced over it was Sakura. She had joined back when they were heading past the fort which they were besieged but she had managed to recruit her childhood friend from Nohr that had taken out her to see the world for a bit when they were children.
""Just...mother..."", Corrin said barely as she had only a few moments with her mother, well a few days during the time her memories came back and she realized at that time her 'father' was. A man that stole her away from her real father then killed him during a raid. It was so heart wrenching as she held a hand to her chest. She wanted peace! She wanted peace with her Nohr siblings and she wanted them to get along with her Hosido blood siblings. But there was no way that was going to happen, she choose a side, and this is the side she choose which her other family would fight her tooth and nail. Sakura finally frowned looking down, but then her eyes finally trailed back up to Corrin. ""We will avenge mother! Besides, you are fighting with you true family S-sister! Mother would be happy to know you are! Once we find Ryoma and join once again as a family we can do anything!"" Sakura tried her hand at a rousing speech Corrin smiled at her stronger now as her stride grew more confident. ""You are right Sakura! I am glad we are bonding so quickly. I want to know my siblings...I missed so much time with you all."" She commented as another behind them just grunted.
""Speak for yourself, Sister.."", The voice was cold and very mistrusting it was Takumi he had a negative look at Corrin since the moment she had joined Hoshido. No matter how much reassurances she gave the archer he refused to open up to her like Sakura and even her sister Hinoka was very emotional when they both talked to her near a village in a valley that she had gone to help in. ""I still don't trust you...I won't ever trust you...I feel you are waiting for a moment to strike us in the back."" Takumi commented walking ahead with some of the troops that were in front of them. Sakura just walked by Corrin as she shook her head, ""Don't worry S-sister, he loves you, he is just having difficulty accepting you completely like us all. I know that...s-sounds horrible but ...it is how Takumi is."" She commented as Corrin gave Sakura a warm smile, ""Don't worry Sakura, I understand..."" she glanced up at the bright Sky with the sun shining down on her. It gave a certain warmth she hadn't ever had while in the Northern fortress during her childhood while in Nohr. She had missed it, though soon it would turn to night as they pressed into Nohr territory. Though she needed direction on her sword and the rainbow sage would help her lead the Hoshidos to victory. ""...O-oh dear ...s-sister!"", Sakura spoke up as Corrn was roused from her thought to look over, ""yes Sakura?"" she asked as the young priestess smiled brightly, ""where is Kaze? He and you have been getting closer lately!"" She asked as Corrin blinked yeah where did he go? He had been coming around and talking to her about the past and everything. It was odd that he was nowhere to be seen.
Just then Hinoka walked up to them laughing, ""he is just with his brother Sakura! Haha! They are talking after that nasty business with Mokushu!"" Hinoka said as she looked at Corrin a smile turned tender and even her eyes watered up again. ""I am glad you are back sister! This time, I won't let those Nohr dogs take you away from us again! You are with us your true family!"" Hinkoa declared as Corrin frowned, sure she was with her birth family but she still felt a family connection to Nohr. However, she made a choice: even if that meant siding against Xander and the rest of them she would expose the King for what he was: a ruthless evil man. The thought gave her resolve to continue on, finally, Hinoka and Sakura could see that Corrin's steps had grown more confident and she had returned to her usual stride. ""That is my sister!"" Hinoka patted Corrin on the back while Sakura smiled brightly, ""we will find Ryoma and be complete again and then we can finish this awful war!"" Sakura cheered which was unusual for her due to her shyness but Corrin smiled knowing it was the energy they felt from having her back in their family after being kidnapped so long ago. ""Yes, as a family we will seek out the Rainbow Sage as Ryoma did and then we will travel onward to the capital of Nohr! We will end this fight so that nobody else has to die!""Corrinexplained as her spirit was at an all-time high!",""", A little voice appeared as Corrin glanced over it was Sakura. She had joined back when they were heading past the fort which they were besieged but she had managed to recruit her childhood friend from Nohr that had taken out her to see the world for a bit when they were children.
""Just...mother..."", Corrin said barely as she had only a few moments with her mother, well a few days during the time her memories came back and she realized at that time her 'father' was.

The thought gave her resolve to continue on, finally, Hinoka and Sakura could see that Corrin's steps had grown more confident and she had returned to her usual stride. ""That is my sister!"" Hinoka patted Corrin on the back while Sakura smiled brightly, ""we will find Ryoma and be complete again and then we can finish this awful war!"" Sakura cheered which was unusual for her due to her shyness but Corrin smiled knowing it was the energy they felt from having her back in their family after being kidnapped so long ago. ""Yes, as a family we will seek out the Rainbow Sage as Ryoma did and then we will travel onward to the capital of Nohr! We will end this fight so that nobody else has to die!""Corrinexplained as her spirit was at an all-time high! She was ready to take on anything that lay before her with her newfound resolve, as the group approached the neutral port town. As they entered the neutral port town, the smell of saltwater and freshly caught fish filled the air, and Corrin's stomach growled with hunger, reminding her that As the group made their way through the crowded streets of the port town, Corrin's eyes widened at the variety of people from different nations and cultures, all gathered together As they navigated through the crowded streets, Corrin noticed a group of shady-looking characters huddled in an alleyway, speaking in hushed tones, and she instinct As the group made their way through the crowded streets of the port town, Corrin's eyes widened at the variety of people from different nations and cultures, all gathered together",""", A little voice appeared as Corrin glanced over it was Sakura. She had joined back when they were heading past the fort which they were besieged but she had managed to recruit her childhood friend from Nohr that had taken out her to see the world for a bit when they were children.
""Just...mother..."", Corrin said barely as she had only a few moments with her mother, well a few days during the time her memories came back and she realized at that time her 'father' was. A man that stole her away from her real father then killed him during a raid. It was so heart wrenching as she held a hand to her chest. She wanted peace! She wanted peace with her Nohr siblings and she wanted them to get along with her Hosido blood siblings. But there was no way that was going to happen, she choose a side, and this is the side she choose which her other family would fight her tooth and nail. Sakura finally frowned looking down, but then her eyes finally trailed back up to Corrin. ""We will avenge mother! Besides, you are fighting with you true family S-sister! Mother would be happy to know you are! Once we find Ryoma and join once again as a family we can do anything!"" Sakura tried her hand at a rousing speech Corrin smiled at her stronger now as her stride grew more confident. ""You are right Sakura! I am glad we are bonding so quickly. I want to know my siblings...I missed so much time with you all."" She commented as another behind them just grunted.
""Speak for yourself, Sister.."", The voice was cold and very mistrusting it was Takumi he had a negative look at Corrin since the moment she had joined Hoshido. No matter how much reassurances she gave the archer he refused to open up to her like Sakura and even her sister Hinoka was very emotional when they both talked to her near a village in a valley that she had gone to help in. ""I still don't trust you...I won't ever trust you...I feel you are waiting for a moment to strike us in the back."" Takumi commented walking ahead with some of the troops that were in front of them. Sakura just walked by Corrin as she shook her head, ""Don't worry S-sister, he loves you, he is just having difficulty accepting you completely like us all. I know that...s-sounds horrible but ...it is how Takumi is."" She commented as Corrin gave Sakura a warm smile, ""Don't worry Sakura, I understand..."" she glanced up at the bright Sky with the sun shining down on her. It gave a certain warmth she hadn't ever had while in the Northern fortress during her childhood while in Nohr. She had missed it, though soon it would turn to night as they pressed into Nohr territory. Though she needed direction on her sword and the rainbow sage would help her lead the Hoshidos to victory. ""...O-oh dear ...s-sister!"", Sakura spoke up as Corrn was roused from her thought to look over, ""yes Sakura?"" she asked as the young priestess smiled brightly, ""where is Kaze? He and you have been getting closer lately!"" She asked as Corrin blinked yeah where did he go? He had been coming around and talking to her about the past and everything. It was odd that he was nowhere to be seen.
Just then Hinoka walked up to them laughing, ""he is just with his brother Sakura! Haha! They are talking after that nasty business with Mokushu!"" Hinoka said as she looked at Corrin a smile turned tender and even her eyes watered up again. ""I am glad you are back sister! This time, I won't let those Nohr dogs take you away from us again! You are with us your true family!"" Hinkoa declared as Corrin frowned, sure she was with her birth family but she still felt a family connection to Nohr.

Now with the encouragement of her sisters, she knew that nothing could stop her, not even her own brother Xander who she still cared for deeply. As they continued on their journey to find the Rainbow Sage, the scenery around them began to change, with the lush green forests and rolling hills of Hoshido giving way As they walked through the changing landscape, the air grew thick with an eerie silence, and Corrin couldn't shake off the feeling that they were being watched, the trees The atmosphere became increasingly tense as the group ventured deeper into the unfamiliar terrain, and Corrin's instincts screamed at her to be cautious, her hand involuntarily drifting to As they walked through the changing landscape, the air grew thick with an eerie silence, and Corrin couldn't shake off the feeling that they were being watched, the trees",""", A little voice appeared as Corrin glanced over it was Sakura.

"Whether or not someone ever really got used to basically being a prisoner, Myrissa Grandison didn't really have a clue. For months she had been there in Casterly Rock now as some sort of insurance that her grandfather, the current lord of Grandview, wouldn't go against them. Seeing as she was the only daughter to his first born son, they thought she would be one of the better people to take as a ward. Her only brother was already married, and he had been in Kings Landing for years now as a representative for the family, so using him wasn't as effective. Besides, isn't it better to have more than one person since it meant more leverage to use against them?
No one there treated her all that bad, but it was quite obvious her place. She didn't have say in much of anything involving herself, nor could she really go anywhere without some guard following her to make sure she wasn't doing anything suspicious. Already she was assuming that now she was in Lannister custody, the royal family would be choosing whoever she would marry whenever they decided to do so. The thought wasn't ideal since they wouldn't have her best interest in mind. At least if it had been her family they might consider her thoughts or feelings a bit more. Not that it mattered much, women didn't really have say in arranged marriages and she never expected to be ale to have any even if it had been her family making the match.
The day was normal, and somewhat boring, just as any other day. Usually she would go to the Sept just to get away from most everyone and pray, and that day wasn't any different. Most of the time the brunette would just sit in there and think. Sometimes she would go kneel to pray to one of the Seven and that was usually when one could tell quite clearly just how slim of a figure she had. Having to wear corsets that sometimes were tied rather tight also played a hand in any woman looking a bit slimmer than she really was.
Soon she suspected it would be close to dinner time and she would probably take it in her room. Usually none of the Lannisters seemed to care if she was in the dinning hall or not. Well except when they wanted to bother her and subtly remind her of the position she had there. They weren't completely horrible captors, but Myrissa wouldn't have thought to highly of anyone she was forced to go stay with and was using to keep her family from doing anything stupid. The thought of dying because her family decided to commit treason, or some other crime, was a shaky future having to walk on eggshells and she very much dreaded that even if it didn't really show outwardly.

Ever since going off with Lord Commander Mormont and a large group from the Nights Watch to find signs of Benjin Stark things had seemed to go downhill as far as Jon Snow was concerned. Not only did they find little sign of his uncle, aside from evidence of his group members, but he had been forced to act like he had betrayed the Nights Watch and join the wildlings. Betraying his oath had been a hard decision but not only had Yorhen half hand kind of order him to, but they both would have died and never made it back if he hadn't done it.
As he stood there now in the same position a deserter had before his father that they had watched behead, it was hard to believe how things had went so downhill for the whole family. His father was dead, his half sisters were prisoners in Kings Landing, two half brothers were thought to be dead by everyone and the other had almost been killed at a wedding. The casualties, he had heard were still high. Both the wife and mother were killed. While he had never been on good terms he never would have wished his siblings mother to be dead. Especially not after the northern army had gone to war because of Ned Stark being beheaded for supposed treason. It was kind of funny in a sad way he was about to follow his footsteps. The only difference was his crime was actually true whereas he didn't believe there was truth to his fathers.
The fact he was going to die on Dragonstone so far away from home was never something he had expected. Actually he had never thought he would die for committing any crime, let alone one where he had broken a vow. Then again what surprise should that be now? Just recently he broke a vow of his own will by sleeping with a woman. That wasn't apart of the whole pretending to join the wildlings to learn information. He didn't have to sleep with Yigrette while pretending to be one of them. That was something he did all on his own with only some egging on by the red head herself.
Jon really wasn't paying to much attention as the acting Lord while Stannis was away spoke. All he could think about was the half siblings he had been close to and what they would have thought of him had they known what he did. Arya might not have cared much, she never was much of one for 'rules' and what was expected of people and the norm of society. Bran and Jon, they were another story entirely. Rickon was to young to probably understand such things and would only know he was about to die. Him and Sansa had never been close on the other hand. She took to much after her mother. Ever since the day she learned what bastard meant she always went to calling him half brother and they hadn't had to many 'nice' moments like he did with the others.
""Do you have any final words?""
Snapping out of his thoughts, for once he couldn't think of a single thing to say. He had watched men be behead and give their finally thoughts but it was different now that it was him standing there about to kneel and have that happen to. ""I've made my peace. I have nothing more to say.""","

~~~
Ever since going off with Lord Commander Mormont and a large group from the Nights Watch to find signs of Benjin Stark things had seemed to go downhill as far as Jon Snow was concerned. Not only did they find little sign of his uncle, aside from evidence of his group members, but he had been forced to act like he had betrayed the Nights Watch and join the wildlings. Betraying his oath had been a hard decision but not only had Yorhen half hand kind of order him to, but they both would have died and never made it back if he hadn't done it.
As he stood there now in the same position a deserter had before his father that they had watched behead, it was hard to believe how things had went so downhill for the whole family. His father was dead, his half sisters were prisoners in Kings Landing, two half brothers were thought to be dead by everyone and the other had almost been killed at a wedding. The casualties, he had heard were still high. Both the wife and mother were killed. While he had never been on good terms he never would have wished his siblings mother to be dead. Especially not after the northern army had gone to war because of Ned Stark being beheaded for supposed treason. It was kind of funny in a sad way he was about to follow his footsteps. The only difference was his crime was actually true whereas he didn't believe there was truth to his fathers.
The fact he was going to die on Dragonstone so far away from home was never something he had expected. Actually he had never thought he would die for committing any crime, let alone one where he had broken a vow. Then again what surprise should that be now? Just recently he broke a vow of his own will by sleeping with a woman. That wasn't apart of the whole pretending to join the wildlings to learn information. He didn't have to sleep with Yigrette while pretending to be one of them. That was something he did all on his own with only some egging on by the red head herself.
Jon really wasn't paying to much attention as the acting Lord while Stannis was away spoke. All he could think about was the half siblings he had been close to and what they would have thought of him had they known what he did. Arya might not have cared much, she never was much of one for 'rules' and what was expected of people and the norm of society. Bran and Jon, they were another story entirely. Rickon was to young to probably understand such things and would only know he was about to die. Him and Sansa had never been close on the other hand. She took to much after her mother. Ever since the day she learned what bastard meant she always went to calling him half brother and they hadn't had to many 'nice' moments like he did with the others.
""Do you have any final words?""
Snapping out of his thoughts, for once he couldn't think of a single thing to say. He had watched men be behead and give their finally thoughts but it was different now that it was him standing there about to kneel and have that happen to. ""I've made my peace. I have nothing more to say."" His voice came out strong and steady despite feeling like he was going to be sick to his stomach. As the acting Lord's expression remained unchanged, Jon Snow couldn't help but notice the mixture of curiosity and disappointment in the eyes of the guards surrounding him, their faces a The atmosphere was tense as the acting Lord nodded to the executioner, who stepped forward with an air of solemnity, his sword at the ready, and Jon closed his As the executioner raised his sword, the sound of clanging steel and murmurs of the crowd filled the air, and Jon's thoughts drifted back to his family, As the executioner's sword began its descent, Jon's eyes instinctively flashed towards the sea, the grey waters a reminder of the vast and unforgiving world beyond","
No one there treated her all that bad, but it was quite obvious her place. She didn't have say in much of anything involving herself, nor could she really go anywhere without some guard following her to make sure she wasn't doing anything suspicious. Already she was assuming that now she was in Lannister custody, the royal family would be choosing whoever she would marry whenever they decided to do so. The thought wasn't ideal since they wouldn't have her best interest in mind. At least if it had been her family they might consider her thoughts or feelings a bit more. Not that it mattered much, women didn't really have say in arranged marriages and she never expected to be ale to have any even if it had been her family making the match.
The day was normal, and somewhat boring, just as any other day. Usually she would go to the Sept just to get away from most everyone and pray, and that day wasn't any different. Most of the time the brunette would just sit in there and think. Sometimes she would go kneel to pray to one of the Seven and that was usually when one could tell quite clearly just how slim of a figure she had. Having to wear corsets that sometimes were tied rather tight also played a hand in any woman looking a bit slimmer than she really was.

"Elliot Harrison wasn't quite sure where she had gone wrong. Maybe it was because they'd spent one night too long in that beat down hotel, maybe it was because she'd forgotten how to use her brain for a second and shot a walker that caught up to her instead of getting her knife out and danger had already been lurking around the corner. Maybe none of it mattered at all because somehow, she was going to end up exactly where she was.
Her olive green tank was stained in patches of brown, dirt and dust accumulating where mud hadn't already and she imagined she hadn't quite got all the walker blood off of her face either. Didn't even know She didn't have it in her to care at the moment, though - all she needed was to keep her legs moving. Each step brought her farther and farther away from where she had last seen Brandon, her older brother, but that had also been the last place she had seen them, and there was no way she was going back. Brandon would find her... He would.
If he was still alive.
He didn't find her. She didn't find him. Instead she found herself holed up in the back of a general store, tin of tuna in hand that she picked at with her fingers as her heavy eyelids begged to close. It had been two days since she had split from the savior's compound and then, when they found her, from Brandon and she'd been alone ever since. All she had was the knife on her belt, the clothes on her back and a tattered backpack she'd found on the side of the road that she'd thrown a water bottle and a half-used pack of matches in to. She'd cleaned up a bit, switched in to a black tank that she wore under a blue plaid button down, and while her dirty blonde hair was still pulled in to a loose ponytail she'd detangled the mess it had become.
Now she wasn't sure where exactly to go from here, though - to go back, while it gave her the chance to reunite with her partner, came with the risk of being caught. Elliot wasn't, and would never, return to the Savior's compound, which made that option non-viable. What else was there to do, though?
So... She sat there, fallen in a heap against the side of a counter, her head resting against a long-dead radiator. She picked at a meat she'd never even really liked because somehow this was what she was destined to do. She would sleep, maybe. Sleep and then hope that maybe the saviors had given up on her and that her brother wasn't too far away. The place was secure enough, at least the back room. The stairs probably lead to a little apartment unit, or at least somewhere she could get through a window to hop on to the low angled roof at the front of the store if the dead ones managed to break in.
Ding-ding!
Just as she tossed the can and it clattered to the ground across the room, Ellie was jolted to attention by a small ringing from the store front. Swallowing, she grasped her knife in her left hand and used her right to push herself to her feet. As footsteps echoed from the other side of the door she hid behind it, breathing deeply as she waited to see if this was going to be it for her. They couldn't have found her yet... right? But the chances of this being random... given her luck? Slim to none.","
